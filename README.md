laravel-setup
===============
There are a few standard modifications that I like to make to laravel projects as I create them. This automates the process:

* Removed compiled asset (css, js) files from version control
* Include some utility scripts to upload asset files, do caching, and show a visualization
* Set some additional standard entries in .env
* Include standard npm and composer packages
* Create a version, readme, changelog, etc.
* Set up to use https in production
